You must actively listen and engage others in every interaction. Whether you are presenting in front of an entire company, delivering feedback to an employee, or having a casual conversation with a colleague or family member, you want to feel confident about what you are saying and how you are saying it.<\/p>\n<p>At Speak and Write Clearly, we believe everyone can build confidence and leadership skills through communication training and coaching.
